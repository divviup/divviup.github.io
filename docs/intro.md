# Overview

Divvi Up is a privacy preserving metrics platform for collecting aggregate
statistics. Using Divvi Up can help users gain insights into a user base while
respecting users' individual privacy, eliminating the need to store PII for
telemetry, and mitigating compliance risks.

The best two places to get started are:

- [How it Works](./how-it-works) - a high level overview of the Divvi Up system
- [Command Line Tutorial](./command-line-tutorial) - use `docker compose` and
  `divviup` from the command line to run a full Divvi Up environment
