# Build Your Client

Once a task is created, client apps are written to take measurements, shard them, and send them to the aggregators configured in [Create a Task](./create-a-task).
Fortunately, there are libraries that make client interop with aggregators simple.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll write a simple app from scratch.
It'll accept a value at the command line, and send it to Divvi Up using the task we created earlier.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript" default>
    We'll assume that you have NPM and Node.JS installed.

	npm create

	write code

	run app a few times
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">
    We'll assume you have a valid Rust toolchain installed.

	cargo new

	write code

	run app a few times
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
