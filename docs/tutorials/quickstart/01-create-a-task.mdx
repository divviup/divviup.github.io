# Create a Task

A task represents a single measurement process.
It provides the type of measurement, the aggregation function to compute, the set of aggregators to use, and other important parameters.

## Step 1: Create a collector HPKE configuration

To collect your aggregate results later on, you'll need a public and private key.
Aggregators use the public key to encrypt aggregate shares, and you'll use the private key to decrypt them.

Divvi Up, as part of its adherence to the [Distributed Aggregation Protocol][1], uses the [hybrid public key encryption (HPKE)][2] scheme for its keys.

Use the `divviup` CLI to easily generate and upload an HPKE key.
```bash
export TOKEN=<Divvi Up API Token>
divviup hpke-config generate --name "Tutorial"
```

## Step 2: Create the task through the UI

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple task.

1. From the `Accounts` page, choose an account that the task should be associated with.
2. Choose the `Tasks` page.
3. Select `New Task`.
4. Fill the form with the following values:
    - `Task Name`: Example
    - `Leader Aggregator`: Divvi Up (DAP-04)
    - `Helper Aggregator`: **TODO: production doesn't have another global aggregator!**
    - `Function`: sum
    - `Query Type`: Fixed Size
    - `Minimum Batch Size`: 5
    - `Collector HPKE Config`: Choose the key you created earlier
    - `Time Precision`: 1 minute

get the task parameters for the client
