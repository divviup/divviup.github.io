TODO(https://github.com/divviup/divviup-api/issues/492): Update this section once we have binary releases.
-->
To install it, [install a Rust toolchain][1], if you don't already have one.

Then, use `cargo` to install the CLI.

<!--

-->
```bash
cargo install divviup-cli --git https://github.com/divviup/divviup-api
```

:::tip
`divviup-cli` is under rapid development.
Consider regularly updating it with the same `cargo install` command above to get the latest features and bugfixes.
